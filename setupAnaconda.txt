set up anaconda

homebrew would help to install anaconda

however, still need to add the following lines to ~/.bash--something (eg. ~/.bash_profile);

# added by Anaconda 2.0.0 installer # could be some other version
export PATH="/Users/username/anaconda/bin:$PATH"
alias pythonA='/Users/username/anaconda/bin/python'
alias conda='/Users/username/anaconda/bin/conda'
alias spyder='/Users/username/anaconda/bin/spyder'
alias pynote='/Users/username/anaconda/bin/ipython_mac.command ; exit;'
