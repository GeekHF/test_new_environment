To set up gcc and call gcc instead of gcc-*.* something

just link the cc gcc c++ and g++ to the gcc-version

take gcc-4.8 as example

cd /usr/bin
rm cc gcc c++ g++
ln -s /usr/local/bin/gcc-4.8 cc
ln -s /usr/local/bin/gcc-4.8 gcc
ln -s /usr/local/bin/c++-4.8 c++
ln -s /usr/local/bin/g++-4.8 g++

c include
$ C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/gdbm-1.8.3/include 
$ export C_INCLUDE_PATH

c++ include
$ CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/gdbm-1.8.3/include 
$ export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH

lib
$ LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/gdbm-1.8.3/lib
$ export LIBRARY_PATH
